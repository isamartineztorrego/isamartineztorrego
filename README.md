👐 Feel free to have a look into my repositories 🔍 and to reach me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabelmartineztorrego/).

Currently working on my own project :construction: but I would love to collaborate with anyone who needs a newbie but passionate data analyst :muscle:

Thanks for stopping by!
